If you did not read ["How to test a route"](route.md), please do it first.

When we want to test a resolver it means we need to mock everything except the resolver and `RouterModule`.
Optionally, we can disable guards to avoid influence of their mocked methods returning falsy values and blocking routes.

```ts
beforeEach(() =>
  MockBuilder(DataResolver, TargetModule)
    .exclude(NG_MOCKS_GUARDS)
    .keep(RouterModule)
    .keep(RouterTestingModule.withRoutes([]))
);
```

To test the resolver we need to render `RouterOutlet`.

```ts
const fixture = MockRender(RouterOutlet);
```

Additionally, we also need to properly customize mocked services if the resolver is using them to fetch data.

```ts
const dataService = TestBed.get(DataService);

dataService.data = () => from([false]);
```

The next step is to go to the route where the resolver is, and to trigger initialization of the router.

```ts
const location = TestBed.get(Location);
const router = TestBed.get(Router);

location.go('/target');
if (fixture.ngZone) {
  fixture.ngZone.run(() => router.initialNavigation());
  tick();
}
```

Because data is provided to a particular route, we need to find its component in the `fixture` and
to extract `ActivatedRoute` from its injector.
Let's pretend that `/target` renders `TargetComponent`.

```ts
const el = ngMocks.find(fixture, TargetComponent);
const route: ActivatedRoute = el.injector.get(ActivatedRoute);
```

Profit, now we can assert the data the resolver has provided.

```ts
expect(route.snapshot.data).toEqual({
  data: {
    flag: false,
  },
});
```
